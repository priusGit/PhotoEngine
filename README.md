# PhotoEngine

Recrutation task.

## Official API didn't supply suggestions and autofill worlds. Because of that, app needs CORS workaroud for suggestions to work. 
## For local, learning purposes I have been using [Moesif Origin Cors Change](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) from google extensions site.

API also didn't supply simmilar tags to the one with have been searching, so top tag bars are generated from hardcoded state - simmulation of what would happen if I could recieve them from server

Everything except that is working without that app i linked earlier.

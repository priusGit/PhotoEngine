# PhotoEngine

Recrutation task.

## Official API didn't supply suggestions and autofill worlds. Because of that, app needs CORS workaroud for suggestions to work, becouse i'm getting it with http get directly from unsplash site, and CORS has some objections with that. 
## For local, learning purposes I have been using [Moesif Origin Cors Change](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) from google extensions site.

API also didn't supply simmilar tags to the one with have been searching, so top tag bars are generated from hardcoded state - simmulation of what would happen if I could recieve them from server

Everything except that is working without that app i linked earlier.
